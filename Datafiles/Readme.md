# Datafiles

The "datafiles" folder contains various data files used in StudyPal projects. These files provide the necessary data for analyzing, visualizing, and generating insights from different topics.

## Structure

The datafiles are organized into subfolders based on their respective projects or subjects. Each subfolder contains the relevant data files and accompanying documentation.

Feel free to explore the existing data files and use them in your projects. If you have additional data files that align with the StudyPal's vision of collaborative learning, you're welcome to contribute them to the repository.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b data-contribution`
3. Add your data files to the appropriate subfolder or create a new subfolder if necessary
