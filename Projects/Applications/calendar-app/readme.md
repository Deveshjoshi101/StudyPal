FRONTEND TASK

Your technical task is to create a simple calendar application from scratch. To reduce the implementation time, please make use of Angular Material and the Angular CDK (this is a MUST, donâ€™t use any other libraries).

Note, the styling of the application is not the most important.

IMPORTANT: Please code this task in Angular ONLY. No React please.

The calendar app should consist of:

1.	Form to add a calendar appointment
2.	Ability to delete the appointment
3.	Ability to move the appointment
4.	Use Date() to work with time/date
5.	Implement mouse Drag&Drop using Angular CDK
6.	Ngfor to render calendar dates and appointments (calendar view)

IMPORTANT: Make sure you showcase your ability. Therefore its mandatory that you correctly use:

-	Dependency Injection
-	Lazyload for module/routes
-	Adding router, router-outlets, etc.
-	Use Angular forms with value changes, validators, etc.
-	Use RXJS in any extent possible
-	Use standalone components and/or shared
-	Angular Material for styles and Angular CDK is used for DnD

HINT: The more Angular features/patterns you use, the better.

Done?

1.	Your project passes eslint
2.	The project builds and can be served
3.	Your app can create an appointment
4.	Your app can move appointments via Drag&Drop
5.	You have ensured all different Angular patterns such as lazyload, router, forms are in place.

Once the task is completed, share it here. In addition, please provide screenshots of your application served locally.
