# Projects

The "projects" folder contains various projects within the StudyPal ecosystem. Each project focuses on a specific topic or domain and aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## Structure

Projects are organized into separate folders, with each folder representing an individual project. Inside each project folder, you'll find the necessary files, documentation, and resources related to that project.

Feel free to explore the existing projects and contribute to them. You can enhance existing projects, add new features, or propose new project ideas. We encourage collaboration and sharing of knowledge to create a vibrant learning community.
